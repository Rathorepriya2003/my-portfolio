            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Priya Rathore. I belong to Madhaugarh Jalaun UP, but presently I am living in Noida.</p>
            <p>My highest educational qualification is a full-time B.Tech/B.E. in Computers from Rajiv Gandhi Proudyogiki Vishwavidyalaya (RGPV), Bhopal, which I successfully completed in June 2023 with a CGPA of 8.57.</p>
            <p>My degree in Computers has helped me instill necessary skills for this job opening. On top of it, I am trying to develop a habit of studying the newspaper daily for 15 minutes. Hence, I feel all these skills put together make me suitable for this job opportunity.</p>
            <p>I picked up a decent amount of skills and gained due exposure during my internship with PS Softech Education Services, which lasted for a total duration of 5 months. During this time, I contributed to designing the frontend of websites. My project work includes 4 months of working on interesting topics like Cloud-Kitchen and E-education.</p>
            <p>When it comes to schooling, I secured 70.0% in my XIIth Uttar Pradesh Board in 2019. In Xth Uttar Pradesh Board, I got 78.0%. My school and college years played an immense role in modeling me as a wholesome individual. At these institutions, I faced several opportunities to participate and excel in numerous extracurricular activities.</p>
            <p>These exposures, combined with several other opportunities, helped me learn methods of communicating effectively in large groups/teams, as well as taught me to contribute productively to a common goal or purpose.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I am a quick learner and believe in learning from my past mistakes. Learning from oneâ€™s experiences is a virtue that can take anyone ahead in their life and career.</p>
